# Overview

An automated version of the NVL Indicator, which enables users to discover what they should focus their time on to get in flow and feel less drained and happier.

#  NVL Indicator

Some things we have naturally within us, and we enjoy and feel good after doing them. Other things leave us feeling either flat or drained, often being things we've learned and know we have to do.

To live life to the fullest, it helps to understand what these things are. With this knowledge we can aim to focus and spend time on the good stuff, minimising what drains us and buffering it with energy building things.

The sole aim of the NVL Indicator is to help you live a happier life with more energy to do more of what you want to do.
