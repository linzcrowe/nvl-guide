# Overview

A way to discover your natural talents and inclinations versus your learned skills.

Focus more on what comes naturally to get in flow, feel more energised and happier.

#  Natural vs Learned

Some things we have naturally within us, often referred to as our natural talents. These are best seen in young children playing, at ages before they have started formal education. These talents make us feel good and leave us energised.

Through life we learn and build on what we know, sometimes in line with those talents but often not. Skills that don't align can leave us feeling either flat or drained, even if they are perhaps what we are considered "best" at.

To live life to the fullest, it helps to understand what your natural talents are. With this knowledge you can aim to focus and spend time on energising stuff, and minimie what drains you.

The aim of this application is to help you live a happier life with more energy by discovering what your talents are, and perhaps how to spot such talents in others.
